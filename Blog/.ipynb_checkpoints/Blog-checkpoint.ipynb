    "## Objective \n",
    "Our objective is to identify and classify objects spotted on images and real-time video using TensorFlow and to determine the accuracy of each identification. We are considering two Models namely, SSD with MobileNet, SSD Inception V2 model and Faster RCNN Inception model to compare the accuracy and size of the models.\n",
    "The principal difference between the models is that Faster RCNN Inception V2 is optimized for accuracy, while the MobileNets are optimized to be small and efficient, at the cost of some accuracy. The SSD with MobileNets detects objects in only a single shot with just two components in its architecture namely, Feature Extraction and Detection Generator, while the Faster R-CNN consists of three components- Feature Extraction, Proposal Generation and Box Classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Faster R-CNN Inception model, a region proposal network is used to generate regions of interest and then either fully-connected layers or position-sensitive convolutional layers to classify those regions. SSD does the two in a “single shot,” simultaneously predicting the bounding box and the class as it processes the image.\n"

    "The whole network still expresses a single differentiable score function: from the raw image pixels on one end to class scores at the other. A simple ConvNet is a sequence of layers, and every layer of a ConvNet transforms one volume of activations to another through a differentiable function.\n",

    "Out of the many detection models, we chose to work with the combination of Single Shot Detectors(SSDs) and MobileNets architecture as they are fast, efficient and do not require huge computational capability to fulfill the Object Detection task. The SSD approach is based on a feed-forward convolutional neural network which produces a fixed-size collection of bounding boxes and scores for the object class instances present in those boxes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between a “traditional” CNN’s and the MobileNet architecture is instead of a single 3x3 convolution layer followed by batch norm and ReLU, MobileNets split the convolution into a 3x3 depthwise conv and a 1x1 pointwise conv.\n"
